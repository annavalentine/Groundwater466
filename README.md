This notebook helps to create a piper diagram from concentrations of cations/anions in water sample. 

Piper Diagrams are graphical representations of the chemistry of water samples in the form of the trilinear diagram. The relative abundance of common ions (cations and anions) are shown by separate ternary plots. 

Click on the "binder" button below to get started, then navigate to the "Generate Piper Plot" notebook and input your concentrations to get started!
